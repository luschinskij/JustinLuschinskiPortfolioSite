Hi, my name is Justin Luschinski. This is my first personal project, a portfolio website I made from scratch! 

The goal of this project was to teach myself how to use the React and Tailwind.css frameworks, and build an adaptable portfolio website in the process. I started out by following a few tutorials, getting familar with both frameworks, before striking out on my own and heavily modifying the original code. Some of the changes include: Adding a whole other section, creating new custom color settings, changed how each element scaled based on the size of the viewing device, rewrote a whole bunch of the text, etc.

I also learned how GitHub works, by uploading my own project and importing a bunch of icons and other stuff from there. Considering this is my first time doing all this stuff, I'm really proud of the results so far. It's a good start!

But I'm not finished with this yet! I'll be adding more features and projects as time goes on, so consider this version 1.0.

To-do list:
1. Add zoom-in feature for skills section.
2. Make the navbar display an underline when you hover over the elements
3. Enlist a graphic design person/artist to create some better backgrounds.
4. Continue updating the website as I complete more projects.
5. Get dedicated hosting.
6. Edit project boxes to look better
7. Fix project icons going over Navbar on mouse over
